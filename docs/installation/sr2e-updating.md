You can install SR2E either from our [GitHub](https://github.com/ThatFinnDev/SR2E/releases) or from [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/slimerancher2/mods/60).
GitHub is the recommended method and you can also download.

 beta versions of SR2E there, if you're intersted in testing experimental features.
:::tip Info

If you choose the Nexusmods option, you'll get a .zip file. You need to extract it in order to get the .dll.
