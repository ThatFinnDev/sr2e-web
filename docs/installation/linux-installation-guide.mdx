# Linux Installation Guide (Steam/SteamOS)

This guide will show you how to install SR2E on a linux computer running **Slime Rancher 2** through Steam.
To use **SR2E**, you need to install its **requirements** first. SR2E uses **MelonLoader** (short ML) as a mod loader and **.NET 6.0**

**Slime Rancher 2** is a **Windows only** game. That means, Steam runs the game through Proton. Because of this,
the guide is going to be a bit more complicated than the normal Windows one.

**You need [flatpak](https://flathub.org/setup) installed for this tutorial!** <br />
SteamOS has this installed by default.

Vocabulary: <br />
Prefix - A Prefix is, in a Proton related context, a container with Windows files.

## Installing Protontricks

In this tutorial you're going to use **Protontricks**. We're going to use it, to install .NET 6.0 and to change an override. <br />
There are 2 ways to install **Protontricks**. Either via the command line or via a supported Software Center, like **Discover** in KDE.

### 1. GUI Method (Discover)

This will only work, if you have a supported Software Center and its flatpak support module installed. If you're using KDE (e.g SteamOS, Kubuntu), then you can use the
**Discover** app.

1. Search "Protontricks" on the **Discover** app, select **Protontricks**
<img src={DiscoverLin} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 550}} />
2. Press the **Install** button on the top right, to install Protontricks

### 2. CMD Method

This method will work everywhere.

1. Open a console programm like **Konsole**
2. Execute the following command:
```text title=""
flatpak install flathub com.github.Matoking.protontricks
```
:::warning Info
Flatpak might tell you, it found multiple installations and it may ask you if you want to install **Protontricks** either in the "system" installation or 
the "user" installation. Both options work both fine, it depends on you, which one you want to choose.
:::
## Installing .NET 6.0 Runtime and adding the "version" override
Now, you need to install .NET 6.0 Runtime. Since Slime Rancher is an x64 Windows game. You need the **x64 Windows** version of .NET 6.0.

### Downloading 
First, you need to acquire the installer.
1. Head to the [Microsoft .NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) download page
2. Download the **x64 Windows"** (not the linux version) version of **.NET Runtime 6.0**
<img src={DotNet6} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 300}} />

## Installing
**Protontricks** is neccesary for this step, otherwise we can't access .NET 6.0 into the **Slime Rancher 2 Prefix**

1. Open **Protontricks** from your Application Launcher.
:::tip Info
If you cant find **Protontricks** in your Application Launcher, you can also launch it with the following command:
```text title=""
flatpak run com.github.Matoking.protontricks --gui
```
:::

2. Select **Slime Rancher 2** from the List and press the **OK** button
<img src={Protontricks1} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 300}} />

:::tip Info
It may take a while for a new window to appear, please be patient!
:::

3. On this screen select **Install an application** and press the **OK** button
<img src={Protontricks2} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 300}} />

4. On this screen press the **Cancel** button
<img src={Protontricks3} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 300}} />

5. Here, you need to select **Run uninstaller** and press the **OK** button
<img src={Protontricks4} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 300}} />

:::warning Info
If **Protontricks** shows a a pop like this:
<img src={Protontricks5} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 200}} />
You can simply press **No** and on then next popup press **OK**
<img src={Protontricks6} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 200}} />
:::

6. In the **Add/Remove programs** window, press the **Install** button
<img src={Protontricks7} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 450}} />

7. In the newly appeared popup, search for your downloaded .NET 6.0 installer and press **Open**
:::tip Tip
If the *.exe* file is not being shown, you may need to select "Programs (.exe)" from the **Files of type** dropdown
:::

If everything went smoothly, you should see a screen a like this one:
<img src={Protontricks8} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 450}} />

8. Press  **Install**, wait for the installer to finish and press **Close**

9. Back in the **Add/Remove programs** window, press **OK** to close it and **Protontricks** should reopen.

10. This time select **run winecfg** and press **OK**
<img src={Protontricks9} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 300}} />

A window called **Wine Configuration** should open
<img src={Protontricks10} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 450}} />

11. Here, you need to go to the **Libraries** tab
<img src={Protontricks11} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 450}} />
12. Enter "version" in the input field 
13. Press **Add** 
<img src={Protontricks12} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 450}} />
14. Press **OK** to close it and **Protontricks** should reopen.
15. Press **Cancel** until Protontricks is completely closed

## Installing MelonLoader

As mentioned before in the intro, SR2E **requires** MelonLoader in order to work.

1. Download the [MelonLoader Installer](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.Linux)
2. Run the downloaded file.
3. Select **Slime Rancher 2**. If you cant find it, you need to add the game manually.
:::
:::warning Incompatibility

**Slime Rancher 2** 0.6.0 and 0.6.1 are not compatible with MelonLoader 0.6.6, 0.6.5 and 0.6.3. Since MelonLoader 0.6.4 has some
issues regarding loading assetbundles, we recommend using version MelonLoader 0.6.2 instead.

:::
<img src={MLIHomeLin} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 450}} />

4. Select the **latest version** in the version dropdown and then **press Install**.
5. If everything went smoothly, it should get this message:
<img src={MLISR2SuccessLin} alt="<image is loading>" style={{height: 300}} />
6. Simply press OK, close the installer and proceed to the next step


## Installing SR2E

You're almost finished! Once you've installed SR2E, you're done!

You can install SR2E either from our [GitHub](https://github.com/ThatFinnDev/SR2E/releases) or from [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/slimerancher2/mods/60).
GitHub is the recommended method and you can also download.

1. Download the latest **SR2E.dll** from either [GitHub](https://github.com/ThatFinnDev/SR2E/releases) or [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/slimerancher2/mods/60)

:::tip Nexusmods

If you choose the Nexusmods option, you'll get a .zip file. You need to extract it in order to get the .dll.

:::
:::tip Steam

If you own **Slime Rancher 2** via **Steam**, you can get the installation folder, by going to Libary -> Right clicking on **Slime Rancher 2** -> 
Manage -> Browse local files. This will open the installation folder

:::
2. Open the **Slime Rancher 2** installation folder
3. There should be a **Mods** folder. If not create one.
