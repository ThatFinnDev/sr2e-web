## Website

Hi everyone! We're proud to announce that our website has new features!
<!-- truncate -->
Starting with version 3.0.0-alpha.1, SR2E will have an API right on its website. Note that, for alpha and beta versions, stuff may
change until its official release. The API of stable versions are not going to change much. If you're considering making expansions or
mods for SR2E, keep that in mind!

We also have a Linux installation guide now! This guide is made for Slime Rancher 2 copies on Steam/SteamOS.
